	  ktap is a script-based dynamic tracing tool for Linux

	  it uses a scripting language and lets users trace the Linux kernel
	  dynamically. ktap is designed to give operational insights with
	  interoperability that allows users to tune, troubleshoot and extend
	  kernel and application. It's similar with Linux Systemtap and
	  Solaris Dtrace.

	  ktap don't support kernels older than 3.1.

	  Your kernel must have CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING, 
	  CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS, and CONFIG_DEBUG_FS enabled to compile.
